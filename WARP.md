# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chinese health and fitness resource repository (`mswnlz/healthy`) that serves as a curated collection of health knowledge, fitness guidance, and wellness resources. The repository includes:

- A simple GitHub Action for notifications (`healthy-action`)
- Monthly resource files containing health and fitness guides
- Multilingual README linking to related projects in the mswnlz ecosystem
- Health tips, workout routines, and nutrition information

## Architecture

### Repository Structure
- `index.js` - Main GitHub Action entry point using @actions/core
- `action.yml` - GitHub Action configuration file
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies (minimal: only @actions/core)
- `202X0X.md` files - Monthly health resource collections (format: YYYYMM.md)
- `README.md` - Multilingual project description with ecosystem links
- `.gitignore` - Standard gitignore for Node.js projects
- `WARP.md` - This configuration file

### GitHub Action Component
The repository contains a minimal GitHub Action called "Healthy Notify" that:
- Takes a message input parameter (optional, defaults to "Hello from Healthy Action!")
- Uses Node.js 16 runtime
- Simply prints the provided message to console
- Handles errors gracefully using @actions/core.setFailed()

### Monthly Resource Files
Resource files follow a YYYYMM.md naming pattern and contain:
- Health and fitness guides
- Nutrition and diet recommendations
- Mental health and wellness tips
- Exercise routines and workout plans
- Medical resources and health screenings

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test the action locally
node index.js
```

### GitHub Action Usage
```yaml
- uses: mswnlz/healthy@main
  with:
    message: "Custom health notification message"
```

### Resource Management
```bash
# Create new monthly resource file
touch $(date +%Y%m).md

# View recent resource files
ls -la 2025*.md | head -5

# Search for health topics
grep -r "健康" *.md
grep -r "fitness" *.md

# Count total resources
wc -l 2025*.md
```

## Content Guidelines

### Monthly Resource Files
- Use consistent formatting with descriptive titles
- Keep resource titles clean; do not append obsolete branding or domain suffixes. If a site link is needed, use https://pan.devmini.space
- Organize resources by category (Fitness, Nutrition, Mental Health, Medical)
- Provide both Chinese and English descriptions where applicable
- Include safety disclaimers for health advice

### Health-Specific Content
- Focus on evidence-based health information
- Include professional medical disclaimers
- Provide practical wellness tips and routines
- Cover both physical and mental health aspects
- Include resources for different age groups and fitness levels
